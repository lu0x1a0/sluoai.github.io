            <h3>Project Description:</h3>
            <p>This is a project to initialise a new sustainable campaign 
                within the HKUST campus that is engaging for targeting users 
                through technologically interactive methods.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Empathize</h3>
                <p>
                    Initially, our team identified existing sustainability campaigns 
                    on campus to gain inspiration upon possible campaigns. We have 
                    identified many through the mind map attached below:</p>
                <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "mindmap.png"></div>
                <p>
                    Campaigns we identified includes:
                    <ul>
                    <li>reward for low energy consumption (in some halls)</li>
                    <li>adding a price for A/C usage</li>
                    <li>additional costs for takeout packaging</li>
                    <li>“say no to disposables” campaign (e.g. straws)</li>
                    <li>display on water fountains</li>
                    <li>various posters (recycling etc.)</li>
                    <li>air hand dryers instead of paper towels</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Interpret</h3>
                <h4>POV</h4>
                <p>After several interviews, we've identified the common issues that 
                    HKUST students have with most sustainable campaigns are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of time</li>
                    <li>Most don't pocess an ample budget</li>
                    <li>lack of feedback on own sustainability</li>
                </ul>
            <hr>    
            <h3>Ideate</h3>    
                <h4>Various Solution Proposals</h4>
                <p>By using brainstorming tools like Metaphoraction, we came up with 
                    5 different campaign proposals:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Virtual Endangered pet for Energy Saving</li>
                    <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "meta1.png"></div>
                    
                    <li>Virtual Forest for Proactive Recylcing</li>
                    <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "meta2.png"></div>
                    
                    <li>Visual feedback from bins to build recycling habits (Simple feedback)</li>
                    <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "meta3.png"></div>
                    
                    <li>FeedBack from Bins to Educate About Importance of Recycling</li>
                    <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "meta4.png"></div>
                    
                    <li>Personal Assistant to help building sustainable habits</li>
                    <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "meta5.png"></div>
                    
                </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Verify</h3>
                <h4>StoryBoarding</h4>
                    We then drafted the interaction method between the user and campaign.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Virtual Endangered pet for Energy Saving</li>
                        <p>The user can view their electricity usage on a display installed 
                            in UG halls. The visual cue of a dying polar bear urges students 
                            to consume less electricity.</p>
                        <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "sb1.jpg"></div>
                        
                        <li>Virtual Forest for Proactive Recylcing</li>
                        <p>This campaign promotes the collaborate effort from student across 
                            the entire campus to recycle by growing a forest from sampling 
                            with the rate of carbon footprint reduction.</p>
                        <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "sb2.jpg"></div>
                        
                        <li>Visual feedback from bins to build recycling habits (Simple feedback)</li>
                        <p>As the user drop something into the bins, the object recogniser 
                            detects whether its thrown into the correct bin and provide an simple, 
                            direct visual feedback.</p>
                        <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "sb3.jpg"></div>
                        
                        <li>FeedBack from Bins to Educate About Importance of Recycling</li>
                        <p>Whenever the user dispose something into the bin. Base on the material, 
                            and whether its placed into the correct bin. The holographic interface 
                            educates by showing the corresponding destination of such waste.</p>
                        <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "sb4.png"></div>
                        
                        <li>Personal Assistant to help building sustainable habits</li>
                        <p>Users will be able to track their carbon footprint of their usage of 
                            different appliances on campus by voluntarily scanning QR codes</p>
                        <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "sb5.png"></div>    
                    </ul>
                <h4>Speed Date</h4>
                    <p>After several rounds of speed dating, we picked the 5th option as its 
                        preference rank was more consistent compare to other proposals. 
                        Upon the design of a paper prototype, we found that we lacked engaging methods
                         of interactions in this proposal as scanning QR code constantly is - boring. 
                         We then considered different gestures that could simplify the experience of the app
                         and maintaining engagement degree</p>
                <h4>Video Prototype</h4>
                    <p>Below is our video demonstration of different gestures that would invoke the mobile 
                        application to track the users carbon footprint.</p>

                    </iframe>                    
                <h4>User Feedback</h4>
                    <p>After receiving user feedback we then refined our interaction methods.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    From this project, I've learnt about the importance of 
                    user participation in development process and interactive design. Also, 
                    I've gained a deeper understanding of the prototyping approach.
