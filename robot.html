            <h3>Project Description: </h3>
            <p> Develop a feasible solution that could extend existing functionalities within the field 
                of education by utilizing Softbank Robotic's Pepper Robot. </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Empathize</h3>
                <p> We conducted an initial brainstorming of areas in education that could utilize 
                human robot interactions to enhance the experience. ultimately we pin pointed down to 
                3 key fields of sexual education, language & culture tutor and teacher training.</p>

            <h3>Speed Dating</h3>    
                <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "robot_files/teach_assist.png"></div>
                <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "robot_files/sex_ed.png"></div>
                <div style = "max-width:80%"><img src = "robot_files/language_instructor.png"></div>
                <p>For each ideas we created an storyboard for showcase in speeddating. During Speeddating we found 
                    that people still prefer to have genuine Human-Human Interactions and robots do not yet have the capability 
                    to replace human aspects of interaction. i.e. user can still differentiate between robot and human. So instead 
                    of having robot replaciung human functionalities, it is better to have robots to combine and enhance experiences 
                    of exististing human interactions or in fields which human are unwilling to have human interaction.</p>
                <p>It was also surprising that people users was more in favour for the privacy gained by sex ed robot compared to the
                     enhancement of features in other proposed solutions
                </p>

                </iframe>
                <p>From the responses For storyboard we prototyped with pepper and later conducted user interviews.
                    Code Sematics for three proposed use case scenarios are attached below.
                </p>            
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pepper engages in interactive conversation regarding consent.</p>
                        <div><img src = "robot_files/code1.png"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pepper presents biological videos/ demonstrations upon user request.</p>
                        <div><img src = "robot_files/code2.png"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Pepper conducting private QA session with students to remove the 
                            awkwardness and fear for privacy for students to ask questions.</p>
                        <div><img src = "robot_files/code3.png"></div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Verify</h3>
                <p>After receiving user responses for the prototype, we identified the following 
                    aspects that could be improved.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Need more physical demonstrations regarding biological learning
                    </li>
                    <li>Subtle wording is preferred. Originally we took the raw video from 
                        UK's NHS and the phrasing was considered too frank in Asia regions, 
                        as well as for mass educational purposes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Interaction methods should consist of more human aspects familiar to user 
                        for comfortable and seamless interactions, while maintaining its identity as a 
                        robot to allow comfortable questioning and non-intrusivity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        During QA and small learning modules, it should ask for user feedback for engagement. 
                    </li>
                    <li>More user customization os preferred. i.e. we should offer a range of voice for different 
                        gender. Perhaos the phrasing could also be learnt for according to gender and culture.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>According to responses, users also believe that robot for sex ed is preferred over human teachers due to its non.</p>
            <h3>Personal Contribution</h3>
                <p>
                    I participated in the brainstorming, interview filming and demo video editing.

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
                This projects brought me insights into the limitations of intelligent 
                robots may be something that we can exploit. i.e.
                A robot doesn't need to completely replicate human behaviours and being 
                limited to unable to conduct judgement can make users comfortable a lot of context,
                 especially for data collection and educational purposes.
